## Overview

A reproducible single-source-of-truth for a personal multi-device dev environment where:

- A laptop runs WSL2 Ubuntu around the clock as the always-on dev host.
- A phone, tablet, or any other PC connects remotely over two complementary paths — VS Code Tunnel for visual editing, Termius over Tailscale for terminal / Claude Code work.
- All sync between devices flows through GitHub — never via USB, cloud drives, or messengers.

This repo contains the setup guide, the systemd unit for the tunnel daemon, and a setup script so any new device can be onboarded in minutes.

## Environment

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| OS | WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04 on Windows 10/11 |
| WSL virtual disk | Default location (system drive `.vhdx`) **or** moved via `wsl --import` — either way, work on **native ext4**, not on a 9P mount |
| Project path | `~/projects/Claude_in_Phone/` |
| **Forbidden work paths** | `/mnt/*` (9P-mounted Windows NTFS — slow, permission issues, breaks C compilation) |
| Remote | `git@github.com:<owner>/Claude_in_Phone.git` |
| Auth | per-device ed25519 SSH key (passphrase recommended), registered separately on GitHub |

> The "WSL moved to a non-system drive" case (e.g. `D:\WSL_Storage` via `wsl --import`) and the default-location case follow the same rule: **work on native ext4, not on `/mnt/*`.**

## Working Principles

1. **Session start = `git pull --ff-only`** — pull commits from other devices first.
2. **Session end = `git add` → `commit` → `push`** — even WIP. Anything not pushed is invisible to other devices.
3. **No direct file transfer between devices.** Sync goes through GitHub only.
4. **Auto-yes vs explicit confirmation** — routine commands (edit, build, plain `git`, tests) run without asking; destructive commands (`git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, `rm -rf`, …) require explicit user confirmation. This rule is global and belongs in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, not duplicated per repo.

## Remote Access

Two parallel paths. Pick by task.

### A. VS Code Tunnel — visual editor

- **Use for**: code editing, file-tree review, markdown preview.
- **Daemon**: systemd user service ([`infra/vscode-tunnel.service`](infra/vscode-tunnel.service)). With `loginctl enable-linger <user>` set, it starts on WSL boot and restarts 5 s after a crash.
- **First-time GitHub auth**: on first start the service prints an 8-character device code to its journal. Read it with `journalctl --user -u vscode-tunnel.service` and enter it at https://github.com/login/device. The token is cached after that.
- **Connect from anywhere**: `https://vscode.dev/tunnel/<tunnel-name>/<workspace-path>`
- **Limitation**: VS Code's UI is awkward on a phone touch screen — use path B for mobile terminal work.

Operational commands:
```bash
systemctl --user status vscode-tunnel.service
journalctl --user -u vscode-tunnel.service -f
```

### B. SSH over Tailscale + Termius — mobile terminal

The path used most often from a phone. Drops you into a terminal where you launch `claude`.

**Networking** — Tailscale mesh VPN (encrypted P2P, works from any network):

| Device | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Laptop | sshd listener |
| Phone | Termius client |

> **Enable MagicDNS in the Tailscale admin console.** Then Termius can use hostnames (e.g. `laptop`) instead of IPs — a changing tailnet IP won't break the saved connection.

**Laptop setup**:
- `sudo apt install -y openssh-server` and `sudo systemctl enable --now ssh`
- Add the phone's Termius-generated ED25519 public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
- Harden `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
  ```
  PasswordAuthentication no
  PermitRootLogin no
  ```

**Phone setup** (Android / iOS):
- Tailscale app — sign in with the **same account** as the laptop.
- Termius — Host: tailnet hostname (with MagicDNS) or tailnet IPv4; Port: `22`; User: your linux user; Auth: SSH Key (generate in-app, copy the public key to the laptop).

**Recommended entry sequence** (`tmux` for connection-loss resilience):
```bash
tmux new -s work          # first time
tmux attach -t work       # subsequent connections
cd ~/projects/Claude_in_Phone
claude
```

**Shell aliases** (optional, recommended for the mobile workflow)

[`scripts/claude-tmux-aliases.sh`](scripts/claude-tmux-aliases.sh) wraps `claude` in a persistent tmux session named `claude` so a desktop session started before leaving can be reattached from a phone over SSH — including approving any permission prompts that appear after you've left.

Install once per device:
```bash
cat scripts/claude-tmux-aliases.sh >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `claude` | Start (or attach to) the persistent `claude` tmux session |
| `cc` | Quick reattach from a fresh shell (e.g. after SSH from phone) |
| `Ctrl+b` then `d` | Detach without killing the session |
| `tmux ls` | List sessions |

## New Device Setup

Run [`scripts/setup-new-device.sh`](scripts/setup-new-device.sh) after cloning — it handles steps 2–4 + known_hosts in one go. Steps 6–7 (tunnel + tailnet) are intentionally manual.

**Base (code work only):**

1. WSL2 + Ubuntu 24.04 — from a Windows PowerShell: `wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04`. Verify systemd is enabled (`cat /etc/wsl.conf` should show `[boot]` / `systemd=true`). Ubuntu 24.04 ships with this on; `wsl --import`-ed or older distros may need to add it manually then `wsl --shutdown` to apply. Step 6 (VS Code Tunnel user service) and step 7 (`systemctl enable --now ssh`) both require systemd.
2. `sudo apt install -y git gh jq build-essential tmux`
3. Generate per-device ed25519 SSH key and register it at https://github.com/settings/keys
4. `gh auth login --hostname github.com --git-protocol ssh --web`
5. `git clone git@github.com:<owner>/Claude_in_Phone.git ~/projects/Claude_in_Phone`

**Optional — remote access:**

6. **VS Code Tunnel**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
   curl -sL https://update.code.visualstudio.com/latest/cli-linux-x64/stable \
     | tar -xz -C ~/.local/bin/
   mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
   cp infra/vscode-tunnel.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
   systemctl --user daemon-reload
   systemctl --user enable --now vscode-tunnel.service
   sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
   ```
7. **SSH over Tailscale**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y openssh-server
   sudo systemctl enable --now ssh
   curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sudo sh
   sudo tailscale up
   # then paste the phone's Termius public key into ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```

## Working with Claude Code

- Mobile use dominates — keep responses short; summarize long logs.
- Use absolute paths — the Bash tool's cwd does not persist across calls.
- Permission mode is `bypassPermissions` by default (`~/.claude/settings.json`); toggle with Shift+Tab.

## Troubleshooting

### Both clients show the same screen / keystrokes mirror across devices

This is by design. When the laptop and the phone are both attached to the same `claude` tmux session, every keystroke is shared — that's the whole point of the workflow: start work on the laptop, leave, and pick up on the phone without losing context.

Side effect: with two clients attached at once, tmux resizes the shared pane to the **smaller** of the two (usually the phone), making the laptop view feel cramped. To attach as the sole client and force the other off:

```bash
tmux attach -d -t claude   # -d detaches any other client first
```

If you want this to be the default on phone reattach, swap the `cc` alias in [`scripts/claude-tmux-aliases.sh`](scripts/claude-tmux-aliases.sh):

```bash
alias cc='tmux attach -d -t claude'
```

Alternatively, detach (`Ctrl+B` then `d`) from the device you're not actively using.

### Claude Code input frozen — Enter creates newlines, arrows/Ctrl appear as literal `^[[A` / `^B`

Symptom: typing echoes into the input box, but Enter only adds newlines, `Ctrl+B` shows up as `^B`, arrow keys leave `^[[A` / `^[[B` in the text. The Claude Code process is hung; its key-input parser is no longer interpreting escape sequences. Often triggered by an interactive dialog (e.g. `/usage`) failing to restore raw input mode on dismiss.

In-session keys cannot recover this — you must kill it from outside. Open a **separate** terminal (a new Windows Terminal tab on the laptop, or a fresh SSH session from the phone) and run:

```bash
tmux ls                          # confirm the "claude" session exists
tmux kill-session -t claude
claude                           # restart cleanly via the alias
```

If `tmux ls` shows nothing or the session is named differently, kill the process directly:

```bash
pkill -9 -f "claude code"
```

The other client (if attached) will exit on its own once the session is gone. Reattach with `claude` / `cc` afterward.

### Mobile (Termius): Enter doesn't submit, only adds a newline

Mobile keyboards sometimes send `\n` (line feed) where a TUI expects `\r` (carriage return), so Claude Code treats Enter as "insert newline" rather than "submit".

- **Quick workaround**: tap **`Ctrl`** in the Termius key bar (top-of-keyboard row), then **`M`** on the regular keyboard. `Ctrl+M` sends `\r` directly and submits.
- **Permanent fix**: in Termius → host settings → **Terminal** → set **Return key** to `CR` (`\r`), not `LF` or Auto.
- **Korean IMEs** (Gboard 한글, Samsung Keyboard 한글, etc.) frequently swallow Enter inside terminal apps regardless of the Termius setting. Keep the soft keyboard in English mode when typing commands; paste Korean content via the clipboard / Termius snippets.

## Security Hardening

### Threat model — what this setup is and isn't exposed to

SSH here is reachable **only over the Tailscale tailnet**, not the public internet. That changes which attacks apply:

| Generic SSH advice that does **not** apply here | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Change port from 22 to a random 5-digit | Internet scanners can't reach the tailnet; no public IP listening |
| Install `fail2ban` | No anonymous brute-force traffic arrives |
| Allowlist specific WAN IPs at the router | No WAN-side SSH exposure to filter |

The actual attack surface is narrower but concrete:

1. **A lost or stolen device** whose SSH private key + Tailscale identity reaches an attacker.
2. **Another tailnet node** being compromised (tailnet peers can reach each other).
3. **Local LAN reachability** — if `sshd` binds to `0.0.0.0` and the WSL IP is reachable from the home Wi-Fi, anyone on that Wi-Fi can attempt to connect.

The items below target those three.

### Claude Code permission surface

`bypassPermissions` + mobile = highest risk of an unintended destructive command. Add hard-blocks in the global `~/.claude/settings.json` — `deny` patterns are enforced even in bypass mode:

```jsonc
{
  "permissions": {
    "defaultMode": "bypassPermissions",
    "deny": [
      "Bash(git push --force*)",
      "Bash(git push -f*)",
      "Bash(git reset --hard*)",
      "Bash(rm -rf*)",
      "Bash(:>*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

- `defaultMode: "bypassPermissions"` makes new sessions skip the per-command prompt by default (matches the mobile-via-Termius preference). The `deny` patterns above are still hard-blocked regardless of mode.
- Setting `defaultMode` may be classifier-rejected as self-modification when an agent tries to edit `settings.json`. Set it via `/config` or hand-edit the file when you're configuring this for yourself.

For stronger floors against a stolen-key scenario, consider extending `deny` to block paths an attacker would use to chain into the OS or exfiltrate keys:

```jsonc
"Bash(sudo *)",
"Bash(curl * | sh*)",
"Bash(wget * | sh*)",
"Bash(scp *)"
```

### SSH key hygiene

- **Add a passphrase to every device's SSH key.** Already-existing key without one: `ssh-keygen -p -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` (rewrites the same key with a passphrase, no need to re-register on GitHub). With a passphrase, the key file alone is not enough to log in even if a device is stolen unlocked.
- **One key per device, registered separately on GitHub.** Device loss → revoke that one key only.
- **Keep GitHub recovery codes off-device** (printed, or in a password manager on a separate device).

### Bind sshd to the Tailscale interface only

By default `openssh-server` listens on `0.0.0.0:22` — reachable from anyone on the local Wi-Fi too. Restrict it to the Tailscale interface so only tailnet peers can connect:

```bash
# Find your tailnet IPv4
tailscale ip -4

# Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config (or a drop-in under /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/)
ListenAddress <tailnet-ipv4>
ListenAddress 127.0.0.1            # keep local loopback for `ssh localhost`

# Apply
sudo systemctl restart ssh

# Verify — should show only the two addresses, no 0.0.0.0
sudo ss -tlnp | grep sshd
```

Note: this hides SSH from the home Wi-Fi too, so e.g. another laptop on the same router can no longer SSH in directly — it must be on the tailnet first. That's usually what you want.

### Mobile device security (Termius app lock)

A phone lock alone doesn't help if the phone is found already unlocked. Termius supports an app-level lock on top of the OS lock:

- Termius → **Settings** → **Security / Privacy** → **App Lock** → enable, set Face ID / fingerprint / PIN.
- Optional: turn on **Auto-lock** with a short timeout (e.g. 30 s) so the lock re-engages quickly after the app is backgrounded.

The same applies to VS Code / Tailscale apps on the phone — at minimum, the OS-level app pinning / per-app PIN should be on for anything that holds credentials.

### Periodic access log review

Monthly glance — even without alerting, check who connected and from where:

```bash
# SSH login attempts in the last 30 days (success + failure)
journalctl -u ssh --since "30 days ago" | grep -E "Accepted|Failed"

# Tailscale peer activity (also visible in the admin console)
tailscale status
```

Unfamiliar source IP or device in `Accepted publickey` lines → revoke that GitHub SSH key and the corresponding Tailscale node immediately.

## Backup Strategy

Single failure points to be aware of:

- **GitHub** — every sync goes through it; account lockout = sync paralysis. Keep recovery codes printed; consider a backup PAT in an offline location.
- **WSL virtual disk (`.vhdx`)** — lives only on the local Windows host. Disk loss = every uncommitted line is gone. Mitigate by strictly following rule 2 (push at end of session). For extra safety, back up the `.vhdx` folder (e.g. `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.*\LocalState\`) to OneDrive or an external drive periodically.
- **SSH keys** — generated per device; if a device is lost or compromised, revoke that key on GitHub. Never share one key across devices.
